# Ideas
# -configuration file that specifies the paths and filenames
#   allow the use of code but with special symbols denoting it
#   allow for using a tag that specifies it's a function (like in sdss_access)
# -how about reading/writing?  just to/from FITS?  return hdu?
# -should we save meta-data to a database and allow for it to be searched?
#   I think the LSST butler does this

# figure out how I would use jeeves for my various pipelines
#  delve, nsc, apogee, etc.

# Ideas from PHOTRED/MAPS, SMASH, DELVE, APOGEE/SDSS, NSC, LSST, JWST
